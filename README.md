Everyface
=========

A project on which I worked on along with my classmate Hajji Imen. Basicly the idea was to be able to capture images of people who are in the field of the camera, be able to store the captured images with the faces in boxes in a DB and Identify the faces in them, be able, through a GUI to give or get the right to check on the stored images. It has also been suggested to develop an algorithm wich can allow us to link the idetified faces through date and time for security uses.
