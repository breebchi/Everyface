Everyface
=========

A project on which I worked along with my classmate Hajji Imen. Basicly the idea was to be able to capture images of people who are in the field of the camera, be able to store the captured images with the faces in boxes in a DB and identify the faces in them, be able, through a GUI to give or get the right to check on the stored images. It has also been suggested to develop an algorithm wich can allow us to link the idetified faces through date and time for security uses. In this project we used a lot of pieces of code found around the internet (I will try to put references later).
We obviously used OpenCV through the JavaCV interface.
PS: I still have to upload the GUI and DB source.
PS2: We didn't finish the identification source and didn't link the capturing algorithm to the DB.
